### A Bit of History

The first computers were just **advanced calculators**. To operate such a calculator, the Operating System was a programming language. Thus the **[IBM 5100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_5100)** operating system was represented by two languages **BASIC** and **APL** (for working with matrix and other scientific calculations).

**[Retroinformática: IBM 5100 (1975)](https://www.neoteo.com/retroinformatica-ibm-5100-1975/)**

Later operating systems extended their file handling functionality. **Unix**, **CP/M**, **DOS** were simplified versions of programming languages for working with the file system.

And even later, with the appearance of multitasking operating systems, applications began to use operating system **API** calls to access devices and display **user interface** (UI).

**[Macintosh 128K (1984)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_128K)**

Now it has come to the point where applications can be created in simple descriptive language **V O I D lang**, and all the complex functionality resides directly in the **V O I D os** operating system.
